// simple loop, requires either SIGTERM or break
a = 10
loop do
  puts a -= 1
  if a == 1
    break
  end
end


// next is continue

block to loop puts scope


// while doesnt has its own scope
while predicate
  # do stuff
end


// until seeks truth, no scope as well
until boolean_expression
  # do stuff
end


// no do-while in ruby, but emulated as
loop do
  #stuff
  if predicate
    break
  end
end

//alternative, not recommended by Matz
